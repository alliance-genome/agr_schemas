          See https://grp.isbn-international.org/ for publisher code lookups.
          For editors, authors and  individual providers, use the individual's
          ORCID if available; Otherwise, a ScopusID, ResearchID or
          Google Scholar ID ('GSID') may be used if the author ORCID is unknown.
          Institutional agents could be identified by an
          International Standard Name Identifier ('ISNI') code.
