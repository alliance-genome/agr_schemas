      be formatted as "surname, firstname initial.".   Note that this property is a node annotation expressing
      the citation list of authorship which might typically otherwise be more completely documented in
      biolink:PublicationToProviderAssociation defined edges which point to full details about an author
      and possibly, some qualifiers which clarify the specific status of a given author in the publication.
