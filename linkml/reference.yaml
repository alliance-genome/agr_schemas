     # the slots below refer to one-to-many associations (ie: has_tags is defined below in the slot section, but represents the
     # idea that a reference can have many tags - in the SQL DDL, this means we need a one-to-many relationship
     # between the reference table and the reference_tag table (or a three-table approach - reference, referenceTagJoin and Tag tables -
     # if we want "Tags" to be a controlled vocabulary table).  Check out the generated UML for more details.

      be formatted as "surname, firstname initial.".   Note that this property is a node annotation expressing
      the citation list of authorship which might typically otherwise be more completely documented in
      biolink:PublicationToProviderAssociation defined edges which point to full details about an author
      and possibly, some qualifiers which clarify the specific status of a given author in the publication.
