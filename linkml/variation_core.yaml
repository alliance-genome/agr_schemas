# Slots

slots:

  association slot:
    abstract: true
    domain: association
    aliases: ['edge property', 'statement property']
    description: >-
      any slot that relates an association to another entity

  subject:
    is_a: association slot
    local_names:
      ga4gh: annotation subject
      neo4j: node with outgoing relationship
    description: >-
      connects an association to the subject of the association.
      For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.
    required: true

    slot_uri: rdf:subject
    exact_mappings:
      - owl:annotatedSource
      - OBAN:association_has_subject

  object:
    is_a: association slot
    description: >-
      connects an association to the object of the association.
      For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.
    required: true
    range: named thing
    local_names:
      ga4gh: descriptor
      neo4j: node with incoming relationship

  predicate:
    is_a: association slot
    description: >-
      A high-level grouping for the relationship type. AKA minimal predicate.
      This is analogous to category for nodes.
    domain: association
    notes: >-
      Has a value from the Biolink related_to hierarchy. In RDF,  this
      corresponds to rdf:predicate and in Neo4j this corresponds to the
      relationship type. The convention is for an edge label in snake_case
      form. For example, biolink:related_to, biolink:causes, biolink:treats
    range: predicate type
    required: true
